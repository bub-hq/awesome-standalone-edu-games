# Awesome Standalone Educational Games

List of awesome educational games and resources that can be turned into stand alone applications.

## Ready to package
These applications or games are already standalone and run off a native system - they just need a healthy dose of Docker package to make them easy to deploy.
* Quite a long list of applications that can be easily shipped on top of a Kivy base and are touch-ready (mostly written for Android / iOS, but run on any Python platform) : https://github.com/kivy/kivy/wiki/List-of-Kivy-Projects

## Needs rework
These applications would need a code rework or adaptation to make them work as standalone apps (for instance, a node.js starter wrapper etc...)

## Would be nice to have
These applications are not suitable as such, but would be nice to have or support in some way (may need to write a client program, change or adapt the resolution, make them touch-friendly).

* ![HTML5](https://www.w3.org/html/logo/downloads/HTML5_Badge_32.png) - Physics simulations - e.g. State of matter - Problem : the resolution is fixed and not touch-friendly. Example : 
https://phet.colorado.edu/sims/html/states-of-matter-basics/latest/states-of-matter-basics_en.html
* A websockets enabled fridge magnet application - All member of a given community can drag letters or words to compose sentences. Still looking for a free one, it would require peer-to-peer or a central websocket server.
* Hardware accelerated full-screen media player - Gnome-mplayer comes recommended on the CHIP (Mpv would be nice https://mpv.io/ ) - Alternatives are :
  * Another option would be https://vlc-qt.tano.si/ to create a simple full-screen media player
  * HPlayer https://github.com/Hemisphere-Project/HPlayer
  * Or go for an already Dockerized application (to be adapted for armhf though) https://github.com/wernight/docker-mopidy
* Background music player (to play while other apps are running, to trigger alarm actions).

# Random Musings 

## Material Design support across the board
It would be nice to keep a consistent look and feel across apps and UIs. Google Material Design (MD) principles are gaining traction and offer a clean and visually pleasing experience. Some existing MD skins :

## Adaptation ideas :
* Run Chromium and Pepper Flash - applications can be simple URLs to existing web resources (implies connectivity) or locally running ones : https://bbs.nextthing.co/t/chromium-on-chip-pepper-flash/2364/3 

## Supported pre-packaged dependency starting points

* PyQt5 + QML + Multimedia support
* QtWebView
* RenPy : Should support Blockly to make Renpy scripts and allow to run them simply.
* PygameZero
* Kivy
* node.js
* JavaFX
* Chromium + Flash
