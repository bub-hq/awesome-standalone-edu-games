# Awesome Standalone Educational Games

List of awesome educational games that can be turned into stand alone applications.

# Ready to package
These applications or games are already standalone and run off a native system - they just need a healthy dose of Docker package to make them easy to deploy.

# Needs rework
These applications would need a code rework or adaptation to make them work as standalone apps (for instance, a node.js starter wrapper etc...)

# Would be nice to have
These applications are not suitable, but would be nice to have or support in some way (may need to write a client program).
